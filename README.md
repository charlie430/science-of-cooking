Meat-Cooking Applet
============
Developed by Marissa Stephens (<marissas@mit.edu>), Kate Roe (<kroe@mit.edu>), and Laura Breiman (<lauracle@mit.edu>)
Mentors: Robert Miller (<rcm@mit.edu>) and Fredo Durand (<fredopdurand@gmail.com>)

General Description: This visualization was created by MIT students Kate Roe, Laura Breiman, and Marissa Stephens for the 2013 edX course Science and Cooking: From Haute Cuisine to Soft Matter Science. It demonstrates the heat diffusion through meat over time.
The temperatures for the different stages of protein denaturization come from Harold McGee's On Food and Cooking: The Science and Lore of the Kitchen (pages 152 and 210). It is important to note, however, that these temperatures are estimates and not completely universal. This simulation is not a perfect model for cooking actual meat. Stove temperatures, pan types, and meat consistency are variable from case to case. 

Uses: Bootstrap, Javascript, CSS, jQuery, d3, Javascript Numeric
